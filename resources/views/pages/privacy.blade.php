                uses,
                and shares

                information.

            <h2 class="py-4 font-semibold">USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

            <p>We use your personal information to provide you with our products and services, to process your
                transactions, and to
                communicate with you about your account. We may also use your personal information to send you
                promotional
                offers,
                updates, and other marketing materials. If you do not wish to receive these communications, you may
                opt-out
                at any time.</p>

            <p>We may also use your personal information for internal purposes, such as analyzing our customer base and
                improving our
                products and services. In addition, we may use your personal information to comply with applicable laws
                and
                regulations.</p>

            <h2 class="py-4 font-semibold">SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

            <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. However, we may share your personal
                information
                with our
                affiliates, service providers, and other third parties as necessary to provide you with our products and
                services. For
                example, we may share your personal information with our vendors who provide us with marketing and
                analytical services.
                We require these third parties to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and to use
                it
                only for the
                purposes for which we have shared it with them.</p>

            <p>We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a court order,
                subpoena, or
                other legal process. We may also disclose your personal information to protect our rights or property,
                to
                prevent fraud
                or other illegal activities, or to protect the safety of our customers or others.</p>

            <h2 class="py-4 font-semibold">PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and
                disclosure. We
                maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. For
                example,
                we use
                encryption to protect your online transactions and restrict access to your personal information to those
                employees who
                need it to provide you with our products and services.</p>

            <h2 class="py-4 font-semibold">YOUR CHOICES AND RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>You have certain rights with respect to your personal information. You may request access to your

                personal
                information or
